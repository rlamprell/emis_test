# Notes

many json files to import

looks like each one has a resourceType of 'Bundle'
and a type of 'transaction'
-- I presume there are other types of transactions available to 



## TODO

(1) sort out the indexing
(2) sort out the nested arrays still in existance
(3) create mySQL instance (probably through docker)
(4) create docker instance for python
(5) connect python to mySQL 
(6) datamodelling of json outputs
    -- discovery phase of the attributes
